<p align="justify">
The project leverages a variety of technologies and tools to achieve its goals. The main components of the tech stack include:

1. **FastAI:**
   - FastAI is used for building and training the deep learning models. It provides high-level abstractions for common deep learning tasks, making it easier to implement state-of-the-art models with minimal code.

2. **Flask:**
   - Flask is used to serve the trained model as a web application. It provides a lightweight and flexible framework for building web APIs and serving static files.

3. **Svelte:**
   - Svelte is used for building the front-end of the web application. It is a modern JavaScript framework that compiles components into highly efficient imperative code, providing a fast and responsive user interface.

4. **Jupyter Notebooks:**
   - Jupyter Notebooks are used for experimentation and prototyping. They allow for interactive development and visualization of results, making it easier to iterate on model improvements.
  
   4.1 **Dataset** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv

5. **Docker:**
   - Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.
